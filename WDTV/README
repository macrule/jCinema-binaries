The Qt libs provided were built using scratchbox2 and the following
configuration settings:

sb2 ./configure -nomake examples -nomake demos -nomake docs \
  -embedded generic -qt-gfx-directfb -release -no-script -no-scripttools \
  -no-exceptions -no-stl -no-qt3support -no-openssl -no-accessibility \
  -shared -fast -no-nis -no-cups -no-libmng -no-multimedia -no-glib \
  -no-decoration-styled -no-decoration-windows -no-decoration-default \
  -no-gfx-linuxfb -no-gfx-multiscreen -javascript-jit
sb2 make
sb2 -eR make install

To make "-javascript-jit" work for MIPS(EL) the QtEmbedded sources have
to be patched first. They are missing one commit from webkit. A diff for
this commit that can be easily used with "patch" can be found here:
